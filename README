It’s a Python application, so Python should be install on the target system.
Python requires two additional libraries: netifaces and Sybase
install netifaces: yum install python-netifaces
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/sap/OCS-16_0/python/python26ucs4_64r/lib/ (is it enough to set it up permanently (after reboot)?)


OMServer requires specific tables in us database – we need to verify that installer creates all of them
sites
tm_prefs
user_privileges
user_privileges_lc
groups
users

PACS installer has scripts to create all tables except user_privileges_lc:
create table user_privileges_lc (indx int not null, privilege varchar(30) not null, description varchar(128) null, licensed int not null )
                

OMServer on Linux is run as a scheduler task, to install:
copy: omserver.service to /etc/systemd/system/
copy: omserver.timer to /etc/systemd/system/

start service: systemctl start omserver
enable service: systemctl enable omserver

list running services: systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

To get license OMServer needs Product Key: select value_ from tm_prefs where name = 'GLOBAL' and param = 'DeviceID'
It should be put there by the PACS installer.


Functionality mimics that of Windows OMServer:
It checks if license file is present.
If it does it creates a hash of license file and sends VERIFY license request to the licensing server; part of this request is unique machine id and product key.
If hash matches response is OK and check is finished.
If hash don’t match response is CORRUPTED and omserver download license again (see below).
If machine id don’t match response wound be POSSIBLE TRANSFER; in this case omserver store this reply in database.
On windows system Study List is responsible to communicate it to the end user, but on CentOS it would be a dead end so far.

Reply from the server could be LICENSE DISABLED, in this case omserver deletes license file.

If license file is not present omserver sends GET LICENSE request; part of this request is unique machine id and product key.
Upon receiving the license omserver stores it to the local file (/opt/OMTCmm/cf/license.dat)
And updates database with max values and privileges. As I understand we don’t have code right now to honor those limits, do we?
